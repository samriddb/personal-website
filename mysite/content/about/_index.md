Hi, I'm Samriddhi. I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I like systems, theory, math and ML. 

I was born in India and brought up all over the Middle East. I've spent most of my life in Qatar. 

I'm in the table tennis team at CMU. I play guitar and percussion and was in a band in high school! I'm also interested in linguistics and theology. I love reading - some of my favourite books include: The Death of Ivan Ilych (Leo Tolstoy), The Housekeeper and the Professor (Y≈çko Ogawa), and Almond (Sohn Won-Pyung).
